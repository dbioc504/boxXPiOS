# Box XP Plus

**Box XP Plus** is a full-featured boxing training companion built with **Expo SDK 54** and **React 19**.  
It guides athletes from **sign-in** to **skill libraries**, **drag-and-drop combo building**, and **interval timing** — all within a cohesive, polished UI.

Soon to be deployed on the official Apple **App Store** for **iOS**.

## Features

### End-to-End Training Flow
- Secure **authentication** and **session handling** via Supabase (or offline mocks).
- Curated **Skill Library** for storing and tagging training techniques.
- **Combo Builder** with drag-and-drop editing and linked-list sequencing.
- Integrated **Interval Timer** that plays bells and clacks during active sessions.

### Modern, Polished UI

- Global design system: colors, typography, and haptics in `/src/theme/`.

### Data & Architecture
- **Repo Provider Pattern** — hot-swap between Supabase and mock data layers.
- **Auth Provider** — secure token management with automatic persistence.
- **AsyncStorage** caching for offline continuity.
- **Zod** validation and strong TypeScript typing for domain safety.

### Audio & Timing Feedback
  - Foreground playback powered by **expo-audio** with haptic feedback for realism.
